For the needs of the Skopje Marathon, implement a class TeamRace with a static 
method void findBestTeam(InputStream is, OutputStream os).
The method reads information from the input stream 
for allparticipants from an IT company 
in a 5-kilometer race. For each team participant, the info
rmation is provided in a new line in the following format:
ID START_TIME END_TIME (ex. 1234 08:00:05 08:31:26)
The method should form a team of the best 4 participants from the company and
 print it to the output stream along with the total running time 
of the members of the best team. The four best participants should be 
sorted in ascending order according to their running time.
Note: In all test cases, there will be at least 4 participants from the company.
